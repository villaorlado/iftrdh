Digital Humanities Tools for Theatre and Performance

This is a space for developing tools and best practice standards for DH project in Theatre and Performance Studies. We are interested in collaborative thinking, tinkering and hacking in order to find the 'holy grails' of Digital Humanities projects: interoperability and long-term preservation.

This space is managed by the IFTR - Digital Humanities Working group.
